Project Learnings:

Created an interactive sales dashboard to track and analyse online sales data.

Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheets and customization using filters and slicers

Created connections, joined new tables, calculated to manipulate data and enabled user-driven parameters for visualizations.

Used different types of customized visualizations (bar chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc)

>Slicers and filters:
 Slicers allow users to filter data dynamically. So by selecting specific
 values, user can focus on the information relevant to their analysis.

>Drill -Down:
 Power BI enables users to drill down into specific data points for a more 
 detailed view.
